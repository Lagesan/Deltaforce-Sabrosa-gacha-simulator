# Deltaforce Sabrosa gacha Simulator

## Introduction

This project is a gacha simulator for Sabrosa (D-wolf), one of operators of Deltaforce. Why I create this project? Because I didn't pull it--yet! **QAQ**
The essense of this project is a few of screenshot and a video, and it is the product of "Vibe coding". So the code standard in the project is **not** identical.
Thanks [@Mr-烟火梧桐](https://space.bilibili.com/407531456), I use his [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1T8wpezEYG).
Also, I use some screenshots from [Deltaforce](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/)
